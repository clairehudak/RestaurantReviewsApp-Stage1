## Project Overview: Stage 1

For this project, I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted it to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Resources
I used the following Walkthroughs as well as classroom lessons to assist me in this project.
I also installed the Chrome extension [aXe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US) to test for accessibility.
